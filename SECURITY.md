## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!--Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.-->
You can report vulnerabilities as an [Issue](https://github.com/creelonestudios/songguesser/issues).
Make sure to tag it with `vulnerability`.

If we do not respond within a week to the Issue, please tell us on Discord: [j0code#7360](https://discord.com/users/418109742183874560) / [cfp#7174](https://discord.com/users/318394797822050315).

##### We will fix it as soon as possible:
If it's a vulnerability *in a library* we depend on,
- either right away,
- or as soon as there is a fix available

If it's a vulnerability *in our code*, it might take us a bit longer until a fix is available.
You might want to make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/creelonestudios/songguesser/pulls) instead.
Making the report as precise and detailed as possible will also tremendously reduce the time for us to find the issue.

We will credit you in the [Readme](https://github.com/creelonestudios/songguesser#readme).

### Thank you all for reporting vulnerabilities.
